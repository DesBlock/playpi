# playpi
Raspberry-Pi based converter for auxiliary audio output.


#### TODO:
- Decide what to rip from [BalenaSound](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound) most likely Spotify, Airplay, and bluetooth connection.
- Possibly use [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library for direct spotify integration. This will allow for use of spotify without any internet.
- [Raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) is an alternative that is just a simple wrapper for librespot. Might help integration of a now playing screen, next, previous, and audio display. 
- Build out project as docker compose files for easy building and deployment.
- Look in to "onevent" option from librespot/respotify to see if possible to be used for display.
